with the following note from the team
"DogCoinGame is a game where players are added to the contract via the addPlayer
function, they need to send 1 ETH to play.
Once 200 players have entered, the UI will be notified by the startPayout event, and will
pick 100 winners which will be added to the winners array, the UI will then call the payout
function to pay each of the winners.
The remaining balance will be kept as profit for the developers."
Write out the main points that you would include in an audit.

1 - HIGH-LEVEL-UNDERSTANDING: skim over each file and read functions names and signatures.
In most cases, although not always, the interface alone provides a good representation of
functionality as well as the entry points of an application. Pay close attention to the
inheritance scheme as it helps clarify the relationship between contracts.

2 - PICK A FUNCTION AND FOLLOW THE FLOW

3 - PREPARE FOR AN AUDIT:
        1. Documentation
        2. Clean code
        3. Testing
        4. Automated Analysis
        5. Frozen code
        6. Use a checklist
